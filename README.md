# Introduction
Hello, my name is Spencer Tepper, a Undergrad Computer Science and Computational Linguistics double major at the University of Massachusetts Amherst!

## Interests
**Language Aquisition:** I am currently working as a Assistant Researcher for the Language Aquisition Lab at UMass Amherst.  We are currently looking into how children process recursive ordinal adjectives, conducting asynchronous experiments using Lookit.
